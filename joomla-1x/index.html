  <h1>LAMP CMS Customizations</h1>
  <p>In the not-too-distant past I wrote several extensions for
   <a href="https://www.joomla.org/" target="_blank" title="Joomla.org home page">Joomla</a>.
   I wrote these extensions not just to satisfy my curiosity about Joomla but to also support
   my personal project,
   <a href="http://groja.com/" target="_blank"
      title="Home page of Groja.com">Groja.com</a>/<a href="http://seeourminds.com/"

  <h3>Joomla 1.X Extensions</h3>
  <p>Having worked with PHP Nuke
   a bit in the early 2000s, by 2008 I was curious about other, more respectable, we might say, LAMP CMSes.</p>
  <p>At the time, my servers were running
   <a href="https://www.gentoo.org/" target="_blank" title="Gentoo.org home page">Gentoo</a>,
   which uses
   <a href="https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Portage" target="_blank" title="Page at gentoo.org describing what portage does">portage</a>
   to keep the operating system's software up-to-date.
   After some research and experimentation, I learned that
   <a href="https://www.joomla.org/" target="_blank" title="Joomla.org home page">Joomla</a>
   was a popular CMS that was in portage,
   which should help make it easier to keep it up-to-date.</p>
  <p>So I bought a few books and wrote several Joomla extensions &mdash; components, modules, plugins, and templates &mdash;
   and keep the code on
   <a href="https://github.com/tomwhartung" class="repo-link" target="_blank" title="My page on github.com">github</a>.</p>
  <p>A list of these extensions follows:</p>
  <dl>
   <dt>
    <a href="https://github.com/tomwhartung/joomoobase" class="repo-link"
       target="_blank" title="My joomoobase repo on github.com">joomoobase</a></dt>
   <dd>The
    <a href="https://github.com/tomwhartung/joomoobase" class="repo-link"
       target="_blank" title="My joomoobase repo on github.com">joomoobase</a>
     repo contains a couple of plugins and some core code that is shared by all joomoo* extensions.
   </dd>
   <dt>
    <a href="https://github.com/tomwhartung/joomoositestyle" class="repo-link"
       target="_blank" title="My joomoositestyle repo on github.com">joomoositestyle</a></dt>
   <dd>The
    <a href="https://github.com/tomwhartung/joomoositestyle" class="repo-link"
       target="_blank" title="My joomoositestyle repo on github.com">joomoositestyle</a>
    repo contains a template, component, and module that work together to allow users to
    customize the appearance of the site.
    This turned out to be a fun way for me to play around with using
    <a href="https://www.javascript.com/" target="_blank"
       title="JavaScript.com home page">JavaScript</a>
    and the
    <a href="http://mootools.net/" target="_blank"
       title="MooTools.net home page">MooTools</a>
    JavaScript Library to dynamically alter the site's
    <a href="http://www.csszengarden.com/" target="_blank"
       title="CSS Zen Garden home page">CSS</a>!
    Alas, although this was fun, it was not very practical.
    But still, <span class="air-quotes">just having fun is fine!</span></dd>
   <dt>
    <a href="https://github.com/tomwhartung/joomoogallery" class="repo-link"
       target="_blank" title="My joomoogallery repo on github.com">joomoogallery</a></dt>
   <dd>The
    <a href="https://github.com/tomwhartung/joomoogallery" class="repo-link"
       target="_blank" title="My joomoogallery repo on github.com">joomoogallery</a>
    repo contains a component that displays lists of galleries, pages of gallery groups, and individual gallery images.
    I had some fun writing this one as well, this time using the
    <a href="http://mootools.net/" target="_blank"
       title="MooTools.net home page">MooTools</a>
    JavaScript Library to add functionality that lets the visitor use their mouse wheel to resize the images.

    <a href="https://github.com/tomwhartung/joomoouser" class="repo-link"
       target="_blank" title="My joomoouser repo on github.com">joomoouser</a>
    repo contains a component and module to allow requiring users to solve a captcha.
   </dd>
   <dt>
    <a href="https://github.com/tomwhartung/joomoorating" class="repo-link"
       target="_blank" title="My joomoorating repo on github.com">joomoorating</a></dt>

       target="_blank" title="My joomoorating repo on github.com">joomoorating</a>
    repo contains a component and plugin that allows rating of content articles, gallery groups, and images.
   </dd>

       target="_blank" title="My joomoocomments repo on github.com">joomoocomments</a></dt>
   <dd>Last but definitely not least, the

       target="_blank" title="My joomoocomments repo on github.com">joomoocomments</a>
    repo contains a component and content plugin that support user-generated comments on Joomla content articles and JoomooGallery groups and images.

  <p>Note that although these extensions are <span class="obsolete">obsolete</span>, some of the code might be salvagable!</p>

  <h3>Why Create These?</h3>
  <p>Why did I write these extensions?</p>
  <p>The main reasons are, I did it out of curiosity, for the experience, and for practice.
   I wrote them because I enjoy programming and wanted to
   learn how to write extensions for Joomla.</p>
  <p>Why these extensions in particular, though?
   Thanks for asking!
   I wrote these extensions specifically to support my main sites,
   <a href="http://groja.com/" target="_blank" title="Home page of Groja.com">Groja.com</a>
   and
   <a href="http://seeourminds.com/" target="_blank"
      title="Home page of SeeOurMinds.com">SeeOurMinds.com</a>.</p>
  <p>At the time, sites that followed the rolling blog paradigm, such as
   <a href="http://icanhas.cheezburger.com/"
      target="_blank" title="Home page of the new and much more myspacey (yuck!) icanhascheezeburger.com">
    icanhascheezeburger.com</a>,
   were fairly popular.
   At least there were several that I enjoyed visiting daily there &mdash; for a while....
  <p>So I thought I would try developing extensions that would support similar functionality.
   Of course now we all have our own personalized rolling blog, on
    <a href="https://www.facebook.com/tomwhartung" target="_blank" title="My page on facebook.com">
     facebook.com</a>.</p>

  <h3>About My "Main" Portfolio Sites</h3>
  <p>In turn, the purpose of
   <a href="http://groja.com/" target="_blank" title="Home page of Groja.com">Groja.com</a>
   and
   <a href="http://seeourminds.com/" target="_blank"
      title="Home page of SeeOurMinds.com">SeeOurMinds.com</a>
   sites is to:</p>
  <ul class="standalone">
   <li>Allow the visitor to input their personality, based on the four pairs of opposites
    described by Carl Jung in his
    <a href="http://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Jung/types.htm"
       target="_blank" title="Link to Jung's General Description of the Types">
     General Description of the Types</a></li>
   <li>Draw an image of the personality</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This was the fourth version of this program.
   I wrote the first version in LISP while in graduate school, the second version in PHP 4,
   and the third version using PHP Nuke.</p>
  <p>So now I am working on the fifth &mdash; and probably <span class="emphasized">not</span> final &mdash;
   version of this idea, with the following goals:</p>
  <ul class="standalone">
   <li>Using
    <a href="../ress/" title="Github.io page about my device detection and LAMP CMSes">
     AWD and RESS</a>,
    because I want the User Experience for the sites to be potentially much different
    on mobile devices than it is on desktops</li>
   <li>Making it much more interactive, now that we all have touch screens</li>
   <li>Making it much more personal, because some types do not like to share their results</li>
   <li>Having fun learning and playing with new tech</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Once the new server is live, there may not much to see at
   <a href="http://groja.com/" target="_blank" title="Home page of Groja.com">Groja.com</a>
   and
   <a href="http://seeourminds.com/" target="_blank"
      title="Home page of SeeOurMinds.com">SeeOurMinds.com</a>.
   But I am actively considering the alternatives, and the goal is to change that very soon!</p>

  <h5>When Technical Debt Goes Obsolete</h5>
  <p>Why are these extensions obsolete?
   As with most things, there are multiple reasons.</p>
  <ul class="standalone">
   <li>The changes made to Joomla going from version 1.x to 2.x were so extensive that most site owners were
    forced to redesign their sites from scratch.
    Many people migrated from Joomla to a different CMS because of these changes &mdash; and I should know because I am one of them.
    Note that because the extensions I wrote were very secure, I was, however, able to run the Joomla 1.x site for
    many years after they stopped supporting the release!</li>
   <li>I decided to upgrade my servers to
    <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/"
       target="_blank" title="Ubuntu.com home page">Ubuntu 16.04</a>
    which comes with
    <a href="http://php.net/migration70"
       target="_blank" title="Page on php.net about migrating to PHP 7">PHP 7</a>.
    And for a variety of reasons, PHP 7 is
    <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/migration70.incompatible.php"
       target="_blank" title="List of backwards-incompatible changes made to PHP 7">
    not compatible with Joomla 1.x</a>.</li>
   <li>There are so many interesting things going on with JavaScript these days,
    sometimes it seems like the idea of using a LAMP CMS for a blog has become rather anachronistic.
    Of course one doesn't preculde the other, it's just that we have so many more options now than we did before!
    Moreover though I really want to make this project into something much more interactive and mobile-friendly, and
    JavaSscript is definitely the way to go for that.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>It would probably be fairly easy to port these extensions to the latest version of Joomla, I am not sure.
   If you are interested in taking on this project, let me know, and the code is yours!</p>

  <h6>Lesson Learned</h6>
  <p>If your site uses very secure code, it can have an extended lifetime,
   but eventually the rapidly-changing technology and even new paradigms and changing visitors' tastes
   can make any site "obsolete."</p>
  <p>In the meantime, I will be using this as an opportunity to find some interesting new tech and
   paradigms to use for my idea, so stay tuned!</p>
