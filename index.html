   <dd>This is a static site, one of the first ones I built, and it has no repo on github.
    It is not mobile-friendly, but it is not obsolete either.
    I like to think of it as being a <span class="air-quotes">cave wall painting</span> and
     I have no plans to update it at any time in the near future.
    Of course, if what I am reading about https in articles such as

     this one on arstechnica.com</a> comes to pass this one may wind up with some sort of "red flag."

  <h3>Adaptive Resume</h3>
  <p>My
   <a href="http://tomwhartung.com/resume/"
      target="_blank" title="My interactive online resume">
    adaptive, interactive, and comprehensive online resume</a>
   uses device detection and
   <a href="https://jquerymobile.com/"
      target="_blank" title="jQueryMobile.com home page">jQuery Mobile</a>
   to present visitors with a device-dependent experience,
   and the source for it is on
   <a href="https://github.com/tomwhartung"
      target="_blank" title="My page on github.com">github</a>.</p>
  <p>When the visitor is on a desktop or tablet, the resume appears as a single page.</p>
  <p>When the visitor is on a phone, the server:</p>
  <ul class="standalone">
   <li>Adds the jQuery Mobile JavaScript library to the code served to the browser</li>
   <li>Breaks each section into a separate screen</li>
   <li>Adds navigation bars at the top and bottom of each screen,
    allowing the user to focus on one section of the resume at a time</li>
  </ul>
  <dl>
   <dt>
    <a href="https://github.com/tomwhartung/idMyGadget"
     target="_blank" title="idMyGadget repository on github">
     idMyGadget</a>
   </dt>
   <dd>The resume uses an Adapter API I wrote named
    <a href="https://github.com/tomwhartung/idMyGadget"
      target="_blank" title="idMyGadget repository on github">idMyGadget</a>
    to detect the visitor's device and serve appropriate content.

      target="_blank" title="My adaptive, interactive, comprehensive online resume">

   <dd>
    The source for my resume is in the
    <a href="https://github.com/tomwhartung/resume"
     target="_blank" title="Github repo containing my resume">
     online resume repo</a>.
   </dd>
  </dl>
  <p>Regardless of the device, the resume uses JavaScript to make the experience more interactive.
   And although it lists all of my jobs &mdash; and is hence comprehensive &mdash; it will show all of them only if the
    visitor really wants to drill back into my past.</p>
  <p>These repos include documentation that should be enough to enable you to create your own
   adaptive, interactive, and comprehensive online resume.</p>
  <p>When going on job interviews, it sometimes seems that they want you to have already
   solved the problem(s) they need to solve themselves.
   This device detection, AWD, and RESS work is my attempt to meet those needs<a href="#notes" class="superscript">3</a>.</p>

 <section id="lamp-cms-customizations">
  <p><a href="#top" class="top">Top</a><a name="lamp-cms-customizations"></a></p>
  <h3>LAMP CMS Customizations</h3>
  <p>I have written customizations &mdash; extensions, modules, plugins, templates, and themes &mdash;
   for each of the three popular LAMP CMSes,
   <a href="https://www.joomla.org/" target="_blank" title="Joomla.org home page">Joomla</a>,
   <a href="https://wordpress.org/" target="_blank" title="WordPress.org home page">WordPress</a>
   and
   <a href="https://www.drupal.org/" target="_blank" title="Drupal.org home page">Drupal</a>,
   and keep the code on
   <a href="https://github.com/tomwhartung"
      target="_blank" title="My page on github.com">
    github</a>.</p>
   <p>I have been doing this off-and-on for many years, since the
    <a href="https://www.phpnuke.org/" target="_blank" title="PhpNuke.org home page">PHP Nuke</a>
    days, in fact.<a href="#notes" class="superscript">4</a>.
    This type of work is both challenging and rewarding, and I would like to find more of it.</p>

     Adaptive Design and RESS Using Device Detection</a></dt>
   <dd>Most recently I have been using Device Detection, provided by the
    <a href="https://github.com/tomwhartung/idMyGadget"
       target="_blank" title="idMyGadget repository on github">idMyGadget</a>
     Adapter API, to implement Adaptive Web Design, or more specifically,
     Responsive Design With Server Side Components (RESS).

 <section id="documentation-and-scripts">
  <p><a href="#top" class="top">Top</a><a name="documentation-and-scripts"></a></p>
  <h3>Documentation and Scripts</h3>
  <p>I write scripts and document processes that help me
   keep my sites functioning, keeping many &mdash; but not all &mdash; of these on
   <a href="https://github.com/tomwhartung"
     target="_blank" title="My page on github.com">
     github</a>.</p>
  <p>I am <span class="emphasized">language-agnostic</span>,
   and happy to work with older languages such as
    <a href="http://www.ef.com/english-resources/english-grammar/english-grammar-guide/"
       target="_blank" title="English Grammar Guide">English</a>,
    <a href="https://www.python.org/"
       target="_blank" title="Python.org home page">Python</a>.
    <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/"
       target="_blank" title="GNU Bash page at gnu.org">Bash</a>,
    and even
    <a href="https://www.perl.org/"
       target="_blank" title="Perl.org home page">Perl</a>.
   As you might guess, I use English to define processes and when giving presentations,
    and I use Python, Bash, and Perl to write the scripts.</p>
  <p class="air-quotes">It's all good, man!</p>
  <dl>
   <dt>
    <a href="https://github.com/tomwhartung/jmws_accoutrements"
      target="_blank" title="My jmws_accoutrements repo on github">jmws_accoutrements</a>
   </dt>
   <dd>All documentation and utility scripts are in the 
    <a href="https://github.com/tomwhartung/jmws_accoutrements"
      target="_blank" title="jmws_accoutrements repo on github.com">jmws_accoutrements repo</a>.
				<ul>
     <li>Scripts are in the bin directory</li>
     <li>Documentation is in the doc directory</li>
     <li>The joomoowebsites directory contains some plans I was working on for awhile</li>
     <li>Images, slides, and other notes from presentations I have given are in the presentations directory</li>
    </ul>
   </dd>
  </dl>
  <p>I still keep most of my Bash and Perl utility scripts locally (as opposed to on github), and
    move them to github as I convert them to Python.
   Therefore this repo does not yet include many, if any at all, of the Bash and Perl utility scripts
    I use on a daily basis (e.g., to quickly ssh between hosts on my LAN).</p>
  <p>Also, there are a very few utility scripts in the
    <a href="https://github.com/tomwhartung/edison_usr_local_bin"
       target="_blank" title="My edison_usr_local_bin repo on github">edison_usr_local_bin</a>
    repo.
   I had to separate them out because they help me quickly find and kill processes and so are extremely important
    when experimenting.
   And while the eventual goal is to convert all of them to python3,
    I could not get python3 to run on the Edison.<a href="#notes" class="superscript">5</a></p>
  <p>Like all the other projects on this page, this is fun and educational
   <span class="air-quotes">work,</span>
   but not important enough for me to focus on exclusively at this time, and so still very much
   <span class="emphasized">in progress</span>.</p>

  <h3>The Intel Edison</h3>
  <p>At a recent
    <a href="https://iotroadshow.intel.com/home/"
       target="_blank" title="Intel IoT Roadshow home page">Intel IoT Roadshow</a>
    Hack-a-thon they gave everyone who attended it:</p>
  <ul class="standalone">
   <li>an
    <a href="https://software.intel.com/en-us/iot/hardware/edison"
       target="_blank" title="Page containing specs for the Intel Edison at software.intel.com">Intel Edison</a>,
   </li>

       target="_blank" title="Page at seeedstudio.com, showing Seeed studio's Grove Starter Kit">Grove Starter Kit</a>.
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>The Edison is a micro-computer &mdash; about the size of a largish postage stamp.
   Having virtually no recent experience with this sort of computing,
    for me that weekend was a huge and wonderful learning experience.</p>
  <p>
   After the event I spent some time writing basic programs to run on it, keeping the code on
    <a href="https://github.com/tomwhartung"
       target="_blank" title="My page on github.com">github</a>.
   Although there is support for other languages, including Java, I chose the following:</p>
  <dl>
   <dt>
    <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/"
       target="_blank" title="Nodejs.org home page (English language version)">Node.js</a>

   <dd>The
    <a href="https://github.com/tomwhartung/edison_node"
     target="_blank" title="My edison_node repo on github">edison_node repo</a>
    contains JavaScript programs that perform basic digital and analog input and output,
    along with a few more fun things that work best using this method.
   </dd>
   <dt>
    <a href="https://www.python.org/"
       target="_blank" title="Python.org home page">Python</a>
   </dt>
   <dd>The
    <a href="https://github.com/tomwhartung/edison_python"
     target="_blank" title="My edison_python repo on github">edison_python repo</a>
    contains JavaScript programs that perform basic digital and analog input and output,
    along with a few more fun things that work best using this method.
   </dd>
   <dt>
    <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/tutorial/sketch"
     target="_blank" title="Arduino Sketch tutorial page at arduino.cc">Arduino Sketches (C/C++)</a>
   </dt>
   <dd>The
    <a href="https://github.com/tomwhartung/edison_arduino"
     target="_blank" title="My edison_arduino repo on github">edison_arduino repo</a>
    contains C/C++ sketches (programs) that perform basic digital and analog input and output,
    along with a few more fun things that work best using this method.
   </dd>
  </dl>
  <p>Most of these programs work similarly in all three languages, but there are significant
   differences in capabilities and the ability to write elegant, understandable code
   once one gets past the basics.
   I have additional repos &mdash;
    <a href="https://github.com/tomwhartung/edison_config_tools"
     target="_blank" title="My edison_config_tools repo on github">edison_config_tools</a>
    and

     target="_blank" title="My edison_usr_local_bin repo on github">edison_usr_local_bin</a>
    &mdash; that contain supporting code.</p>
  <p>I bought several books, most of which are published by
    <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/"
     target="_blank" title="O'Reilly.com home page">O'Reilly</a>,
    to help guide me through all this.
   This entire project has been a huge amount of fun!</p>

  <h3>Lifelong Learner</h3>
  <p>I am a lifelong learner and have recently started keeping some of what I am learing on

   </dt>
   <dd>I have been learning JavaScript and CSS in the background (so to speak) for many years.
    Both seem to be constantly undergoing significant changes, and
     it is important to spend some time on occasion keeping up with these,
     because JavaScript is ubiquitous, and you never know....

    <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/shows/pwa-devsummit/?hl=en"
      target="_blank" title="">Progressive Web Apps</a>
   </dt>
   <dd>I am very excited about this new technology allows visitors to save a site to their phone's home screen!
    This looks like a great idea for my
     <a href="http://groja.com/" target="_blank" title="Home page of groja.com">
      groja.com</a>/<a href="http://seeourminds.com/"
        target="_blank" title="Home page of seeourminds.com">seeourminds.com</a>
     project.
    However, at this time (2015-08-02) it works properly only on Android Phones, and my mobile phone is an Apple.
    Bummer, right?  Well that is exactly why they call it "Progressive..." &mdash; but that's another story.
    There are some online tutorials and classes at
     <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/getting-started/your-first-progressive-web-app/step-02?hl=en"
        target="_blank" title="">developers.google.com</a>

  <p>Along with other benefits, keeping the code I write for these classes on github allows me to
    start coding for a class on one pc, commit and push what I've done, and
    resume the class or tutorial on another pc.  Sweet!</p>
